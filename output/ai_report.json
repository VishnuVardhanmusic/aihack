The festive demand spike in Q4 2023 is expected to partially carry over into Q1 2024, despite the Chinese New Year slowdown. The global semiconductor shortage and US export restrictions on advanced chips to China may lead to increased demand in other regions, while EV adoption rates in Europe are expected to drive growth in the automotive segment.",
